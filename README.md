## Abstract
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created an unprecedented demand for data centers. However, increasing data center electricity demand can strain electricity grids without careful resource planning practices. This study investigates the grid stress and reliability impacts of projected future data centers in the United States (U.S.) Western Interconnection between 2025 and 2035 without compensating power system upgrades. Moreover, we explore the potential benefits of two impact mitigation strategies: delaying scheduled generator retirements and data center demand response through curtailment. We analyze benefits in terms of wholesale electricity prices and unserved energy events across four data center demand growth rates: 3.71%, 5%, 10%, and 15% annually. The results indicate that data centers can cause substantial grid stress and outages in the U.S. Western Interconnection if future generation and transmission plans do not consider these large loads by 2035. Depending on data center demand growth levels, increases in annual average wholesale electricity prices range from 43% to 203% in 2035. Increases in the number of annual unserved energy hours vary between 159 and 507 hours in 2035. Postponing scheduled retirements of natural gas and nuclear generators (20.3 GW to 32.7 GW) can eliminate grid stress and reliability impacts in most regions. Despite having value during grid stress periods, curtailment of data center demands is insufficient to eliminate all data center driven grid stress and reliability issues in 2035. More efficient utilization of data center demand response can be achieved if it is combined with new generation and transmission capacity.

## Reproduce my experiment
Use the scripts/files found in the `workflow` directory to reproduce the experiment presented in this publication. 
- Please check and make sure that all the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed in your local Python environment.
- Please download [input](#input-data)/[output](#output-data)/[supplementary](#supplementary-data) datasets.
- Please update all the paths in the configuration files and scripts so that they point to the local paths of the downloaded [input](#input-data)/[output](#output-data)/[supplementary](#supplementary-data) datasets.
- By default, transmission network optimization outputs from TEP is fed into GO and used as an input.

| Script/File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GO_config.yml` | Configuration file containing paths to the input/output files of GO |
| `GO_simulation.py` | Script that creates GO model input database and starts GO model simulation |
| `TEP_config.yml` | Configuration file containing paths to the input/output files and model settings of TEP |
| `TEP_setup.py` | Script that prepares TEP model input database |
| `TEP_simulation.py` | Script that starts TEP model simulation |

### Steps of running GO
1. Example `GO_config.yml` file includes paths to the inputs/outputs for scenario `rcp45cooler_ssp3` and year `2050`. Determine which scenario/year you would like to run and alter the paths in `GO_config.yml` so that they point to the specific [input](#input-data)/[output](#output-data)/[supplementary](#supplementary-data) datasets.
2. Make sure `my_config_file_path` parameter in `GO_simulation.py` script points to the path of `GO_config.yml` file.
3. `my_simulation_days` parameter in `GO_simulation.py` script defaults to a full-year. If you need to simulate only a certain part of the year, adjust `my_simulation_days` accordingly.
4. Change `my_solver_name` parameter in `GO_simulation.py` script so that it matches the solver you would like to use. Make sure that the solver you would like to use can be accessed via [pyomo](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo) package.
5. Run `GO_simulation.py` and analyze/compare the outputs.
6. Restart from step 1 for every different scenario/year you would like to simulate. 

### Steps of running TEP
1. Example `TEP_config.yml` file includes paths to the inputs/outputs for scenario `rcp45cooler_ssp3` and year `2050`. Determine which scenario/year you would like to run and alter the paths in `TEP_config.yml` so that they point to the specific [input](#input-data)/[output](#output-data)/[supplementary](#supplementary-data) datasets. Note that `existing_line_param_file` and `existing_line_param_output_file` point to year t-5 to reflect transmission network in previous timestep. 
2. Please do not change the settings (i.e., last three parameters in `TEP_config.yml`), if you would like to get the same results presented in this paper. 
3. Make sure `my_config_file_path` parameter in `TEP_setup.py` script points to the path of `TEP_config.yml` file.
4. Run `TEP_setup.py` to create TEP model input database.
5. Make sure `my_config_file_path` parameter in `TEP_simulation.py` script points to the path of `TEP_config.yml` file.
6. Change `my_solver_name` parameter in `TEP_simulation.py` script so that it matches the solver you would like to use. Make sure that the solver you would like to use can be accessed via [pyomo](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo) package.
7. Run `TEP_simulation.py` and analyze/compare the outputs.
8. Restart from step 1 for every different scenario/year you would like to simulate.
