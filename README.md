## Abstract
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created an unprecedented demand for data centers. However, increasing data center electricity demand can strain electricity grids without careful resource planning and operational practices. This study investigates the projected grid stress and reliability impacts of data centers in the U.S. Western Interconnection between 2025 and 2035, assuming no compensating power system upgrades exclusively for future data centers. We also explore the potential benefits of two impact mitigation strategies: delaying scheduled generator retirements and curtailing hourly data center demands up to 15%. We analyze grid stress and reliability in terms of wholesale electricity prices and unserved energy events across four data center demand growth rates: 3.71%, 5%, 10%, and 15% annually. The results indicate that although the impacts are relatively low by 2030, data centers could cause substantial grid stress and outages in the U.S. Western Interconnection by 2035 if future generation and transmission plans do not consider these large loads. Without mitigation, increases in annual average wholesale electricity prices range from 43% to 203%, and increases in the number of annual unserved energy hours vary between 159 and 507 hours in 2035. We show that postponing scheduled retirements of natural gas and nuclear generators (20.3 GW to 32.7 GW) can eliminate these impacts in most regions. Despite having value during grid stress periods, curtailing data center demands alone is insufficient to eliminate grid stress impacts. Our results emphasize the need for a portfolio of responses by the energy sector to minimize data center impacts.

## Reproduce my experiment
Use the scripts/files found in the `workflow` directory to reproduce the experiment presented in this publication. 
- Please check and make sure that all the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed in your local Python environment.
- Please download [input](#input-data)/[output](#output-data)/[supplementary](#supplementary-data) datasets.
- Please update all the paths in the configuration files and scripts so that they point to the local paths of the downloaded [input](#input-data)/[output](#output-data)/[supplementary](#supplementary-data) datasets.

| Script/File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GO_config.yml` | Configuration file containing paths to the input/output files of GO |
| `GO_simulation.py` | Script that creates GO model input database and starts GO model simulation |

### Steps of running GO
1. Example `GO_config.yml` file includes paths to the inputs/outputs for `rcp45hotter_ssp3`/`low_growth`/`dr_cost_500_drup_0_drdown_15` scenario combination and the year `2035`. Determine which scenario/year you would like to run and alter the paths in `GO_config.yml` so that they point to the specific [input](#input-data)/[output](#output-data)/[supplementary](#supplementary-data) datasets.
2. Make sure `my_config_file_path` parameter in `GO_simulation.py` script points to the path of `GO_config.yml` file.
3. `my_simulation_days` parameter in `GO_simulation.py` script defaults to a full-year. If you need to simulate only a certain part of the year, adjust `my_simulation_days` accordingly.
4. Change `my_solver_name` parameter in `GO_simulation.py` script so that it matches the solver you would like to use. Make sure that the solver you would like to use can be accessed via [pyomo](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo) package.
5. `my_dr_cost` parameter in `GO_simulation.py` script defaults to 250 $/MWh demand response compensation cost. Adjust `my_dr_cost` according to the specific scenario you would like to simulate.
6. Run `GO_simulation.py` and analyze/compare the outputs.
7. Restart from step 1 for every different scenario/year you would like to simulate.
